# Git Workflow

## Commit Messages

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Keep commits focused on single changes
- Use conventional commit format when possible

- Changes relevant to the API or UI:
  - feat Commits that add, adjust or remove a new feature to the API or UI
  - fix Commits that fix an API or UI bug of a preceded feat commit
- refactor Commits that rewrite or restructure code without altering API or UI behavior
  - perf Commits are special type of refactor commits that specifically improve performance
- style Commits that address code style (e.g., white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons) and do not affect application behavior
- test Commits that add missing tests or correct existing ones
- docs Commits that exclusively affect documentation
- build Commits that affect build-related components such as build tools, dependencies, project version, ...
- ops Commits that affect operational aspects like infrastructure (IaC), deployment scripts, CI/CD pipelines, backups, monitoring, or recovery procedures, ...
- chore Commits that represent tasks like initial commit, modifying .gitignore, ...

**Examples:**

```
feat: add user profile screen
fix: resolve database migration error
refactor: simplify authentication logic
docs: update API documentation
```
